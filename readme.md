### Coding puzzle solutions

To run a solution, execute:

```js
node . [projectName] puzzleNum
```

`projectName` defaults to `solutions`, which are project euler solutions. For example, for advent
2018 puzzle #1, run:

```js
node . advent2018 1
```

Advent puzzles need your session cookie to pull data. Copy it from your browser and stick it in
`advent-cookie.js` in the root dir, and blow away the contents of `resources/advent2018` to pull
data from your own account
